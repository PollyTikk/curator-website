    <h3>Three-month long interdisciplinary residency encouraged 14 international participants to explore intersections of healing, technology, community, ecology, writing and somatic practices.           
    </h3>

    <a target="blank" ><img src="./images/medley-sketch-of-project-1200w.jpg" /></a>

    <p style="font-size: 0.8em;">‘Attunement in Practice’ was a final exhibition inviting audience to engage with residents’ work through performances, installations, readings and somatic sessions.</p>
    <p>

        Fourteen residents (8 from Berlin, 6 from abroad) were offered 24/7 access to the Medley space in Berlin-Mitte and an invitation to gather, work, play, produce, host events, and explore the common space. <a target="blank" href="https://www.medley.berlin/residency ">More about Medley Residency</a>

    <h2>Singen3000 Community Choir</h2>
    <h3>Grassroots community project evolved around passion for polyphonic singing and queer values.    
    </h3>
    <a target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/singen3000/"><img src="./images/singen3000-choir-width620-2.jpg" /></a>
        <p>
            Apart from sheer beauty of singing together, the community choir Singen3000 has set its goal to increase the accessibility of communal singing for people without music education. This is achieved by integrating intuitive folk songs into the repertoire and creating audio learning materials for more complex arrangements. 
            In the season of 2022-2023 with the support of European Solidarity Corps the choir is aiming to extend its community and reach out to people displaced by Russian aggression in Ukraine.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 60px;"  >PARALLEL Residency</h2>

    <h3>New technologies are changing the way we organise our communities and societies. But where do these changes lead us? Towards a greater sense of connectedness? Or to atomisation and fragmentation?

        Connected through a common programme and characterised by continual dialogue PARALLEL provided the opportunity for 16 artists to engage with these questions and collaborate across borders and disciplines in the framework of a dual residency: in the heart of urban Tbilisi in Georgia and rural Schloss Schönow in Germany. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Residency culminated in the series of live performances and collaborative artworks, which were presented and curated online.
